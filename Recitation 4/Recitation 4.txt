Gale-Shapley and GS Extended: implementation
- Video can be accessed using your Columbia email at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jNlH1c-Y3mJbcF57Lad2-C3lgyZg3q6x/view?usp=sharing
- Related file: Gale_Shapley.ipynb
- This file contains an implementation of the GS stable matching algorithm and an implementation of the GS extended algorithm for finding a pareto-optimal matching. It also has helper functions to generate matching instances, find blocking pairs of a given matching, compare two matchings, etc.
- In the video I give a line-by-line walk-through of the code

Graph Coloring IP formulation: IP explained, gurobi implementation
- Video can be accessed using your Columbia email at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TLSG4QGMaS3f02mQs5JEWDewpdp4YSlp/view?usp=sharing
- Related file: Graph_Coloring.ipynb, IP for graph coloring.pdf
- The pdf file explains how to formulate graph coloring as an IP problem
- The ipynb file contains an implementation of the graph coloring IP
- In the video I first explain how to formulate graph coloring as an IP and then give a line-by-line walk-through of the implementation
